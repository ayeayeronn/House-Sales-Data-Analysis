# House-Sales-Data-Analysis

Upon completion of IBM's Data Analysis with Python course on Coursera, this project reinforced my understanding of concepts introduced in the class. The goal was to explore a dataset containing characteristics of homes sold within King County, USA and determining which variables influence the price homes sold for. Skills that were demonstrated include: understanding the data, cleaning the data, visualizing, and model development.
